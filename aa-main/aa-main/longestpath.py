# **14. Longest Path in a Graph**

# #### **Aim**  
# To find the longest path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

# #### **Working**  
# The algorithm performs a topological sort of the graph and uses dynamic programming to compute the longest path.

# #### **Pseudo Code**  
# ```  
# Algorithm: Longest Path  
# Input: DAG G with weights  
# Output: Longest path length  

# 1. Perform topological sort on G  
# 2. Initialize dist[v] = -âˆž for all vertices except source = 0  
# 3. for each vertex u in topological order do  
# 4.     for each neighbor v of u do  
# 5.         if dist[v] < dist[u] + weight(u, v) then  
# 6.             dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)  
# 7. Return max(dist[v])  
# ```

# #### **Complexity and Recurrence Formula**  
# - **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\)  
# - **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\)  

# #### **Conclusion**  
# The longest path algorithm is a key tool in scheduling and optimization problems involving DAGs.
