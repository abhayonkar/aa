### **3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**

# #### **Aim**  
# To compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

# #### **Working**  
# The algorithm iteratively updates the shortest path between all pairs of vertices using a dynamic programming approach, checking if paths through an intermediate vertex yield a shorter route.

# #### **Pseudo Code**  
# ```  
# Algorithm: Floyd-Warshall  
# Input: Graph G with vertices V and weights W  
# Output: All-pairs shortest path distances  

# 1. Initialize dist[i][j] = W[i][j] for all edges, âˆž for no direct edge  
# 2. for k = 1 to |V| do  
# 3.     for i = 1 to |V| do  
# 4.         for j = 1 to |V| do  
# 5.             dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])  
# 6. Return dist  
# ```

# #### **Complexity and Recurrence Formula**  
# - **Time Complexity**: \(O(V^3)\)  
# - **Space Complexity**: \(O(V^2)\)  
# - **Recurrence Relation**:  
#   \(dist[i][j] = \min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])\)

# #### **Conclusion**  
# Floyd-Warshall is a simple and effective algorithm for dense graphs but is inefficient for sparse graphs due to its cubic time complexity.
